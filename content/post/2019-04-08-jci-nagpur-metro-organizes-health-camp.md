Follwed by the Health Checkup Camp, we took trainings of women at the same venue where more than 150 women were guided on many topics. 

JCI Nagpur Metro founder president JFM. G. V. Anand Sharma sir, JCINM Advisor HGF Usha Dhok madam, IPP Rajveer Singh, Sr Member Vijay Kumar sir, active member Tushar Gulhane ji honour us with their presence.

I would like give special thanks to Akhil Bhartiya Pariwar for their support and Jay Durga Bahu Uddeshiya Shikshan Sanstha for availability of the venue.
