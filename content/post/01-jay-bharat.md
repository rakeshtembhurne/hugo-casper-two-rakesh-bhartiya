title: Why I Started This Blog?
---


For so long, I have been working as a techie and I got good expertise over technical things. But somewhere in my mind, I was aware I am being nearer to machines than people. I was feeling that I am no more a social person and hence I had to do something for it.

I started working on social works and getting involved in various organizations. After meeting a lot of people I finally decided that I will work with a few selected organizations. Since then I wanted to share my thoughts and experiences but my original blog https://rakesh.tembhurne.com was only technical and I wanted to keep it that way.

So I started this new blog which will completely about of my social life. For my technical life, I will use my old blog. This way I can separate my professional and social experiences.

## Why name ‘Bhartiya’


I joined Akhil Bhartiya Parivar because I believe in the mission they have - to build a united India with no differentiation of religions, cast, gender or colour. I think India needs such a concept with passionate people working on it.

One of the condition to join the Akhil Bhartiya Parivar is that we add Bhartiya word to the name. So I thought to begin my new social life with the same name.

On a social level, I am currently working with JCI India and ABP. I am sure I will learn a lot of new things and people can be benefited from my experiences.
